Airbnb's gross profit in 2023 was nearly $8 billion, more than a 20% increase year-over-year. Let's take a look at what led to Airbnb's boom with Beyond the Ticker, where we dive into some of the company's biggest moments. 2007 In 2007, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia created the initial concept for Airbnb. 2008 One year later, the Airbedandbreakfast.com website launched – renting out 3 air mattresses within their San Francisco loft. 2009 In 2009, the website was shortened to Airbnb.com and expanded from air beds and shared spaces to a wide variety of properties. Later that year, Airbnb raised $585,000 from Sequoia Capital in a seed round – valuing the company at $2.4 million. 2011 By 2011, Airbnb announced it hit 1 million bookings on its website and reached ""unicorn"" status – the privately owned startup was now valued at $1 billion. 2014 Airbnb completed a redesign of its site and mobile app in 2014, including the new Bélo logo. Later that year, San Francisco voted “No” to a measure to restrict Airbnb rentals in the city. The company spent more than $8 million in its ad campaign in the lead-up to the vote. 2016-2024 Since 2016, Airbnb has expanded through several strategic launches and acquisitions, including Trip4real, Airbnb Experiences, Luxury Retreats, Niido, Airbnb Plus, and HotelTonight 2020 On December 10, 2020, Airbnb went public via initial public offering at $68 a share, raising $3.5 billion. The company was valued at $47 billion. 2023 With plans to expand its AI services, Airbnb acquired GamePlanner.AI in 2023. Airbnb CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky said, ""Airbnb is one of the more humanistic companies in technology, and I believe that ... we can develop some of the best interfaces and practical applications for AI.” From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

The last time the booking platform reported a solid performance, it was overshadowed by a less than rosy outlook for the fourth quarter. So what should you look out for this quarter? Here are the three things you need to watch. #1 Booking Growth: Looking out for two key metrics: first —  gross booking value. That’s the total amount of payments processed on the platform: everything from host payments to cleaning fees, but it does not include cancellations. Last quarter gross booking value – landed over 18 billion dollars, 17% gain from the prior-year. Then –  there’s nights and experiences booked: the platform reported over 100 million bookings for the quarter – which topped Wall Street’s estimates. Now – as we turn to the fourth quarter — the revenue figure will be closely watched, as the company guided a little below expectations. #2 International Expansion: In the last quarter – Airbnb said their expansion plans into international markets is ‘gaining momentum’. Keep an eye on what it is called ‘under-penetrated markets’ — that means a market with little competition for the same service. Asia Pacific is one, but also take into account markets like Germany, Brazil and Korea. Beyond that, its an important to have a pulse on *anything* the company has to say about AI, and how it could be a game changer for international growth in the coming months. #3 Regulation: Another key area to watch. In the third quarter, Airbnb slightly saw higher prices for short-term rentals - but this area could be hurt by changes in the regulatory landscape. For example – New York City’s new law —  requires all short-term rental hosts to register with the city, they must show when their guests are staying - and only two guests can stay at a time. This applies to all other platforms like VRBO and Booking.com. The big question here, will other cities follow suit and what could it mean in the long- term? There’s a lot to digest as we look at Airbnb's fourth quarter earnings, and Yahoo Finance will be tackling the latest developments.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5e0271f0ccc1fdbdf3e662fbc87e07bfd2cd0d12ed335e116cb897adb4e6f1d9

As consumers become more cautious with spending, some on Wall Street are wondering where to best position their portfolio to capitalize on these trends. Ronald Josey, Citi Research Internet Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss travel stocks and where investors should keep an eye out for opportunities. Josey mentions Booking Holdings (BKNG) as one of this top picks, citing: ""It is a matter of scale. There's no ifs, ands or buts about it. The more hotels you have, in what is an increasingly supply-driven market, the more you can generate greater demand. Booking having as many hotels as they do in Europe, increasingly in North America, also also in Asia-Pac, and, we think they're among the best positioned to benefit from this continued trend of travel... The thing that Booking has not just the scale in hotels to your question, it's also the know how and marketing efficiency on how to really go after those consumers that are willing and able to and want to spend on travel, and that's a super power that I think Booking has that everybody wants to emulate.""

Pantheon Macroeconomics Founder and Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson joins Yahoo Finance as part of the Travel Guide 2024: Industry Insights special, commenting on wage growth and consumers' savings coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""There's a lot less savings hanging around that was built up during the pandemic. And if you look at the distribution of where that money is still sat, it's almost entirely in the hands of the top 20%. Most households now don't have any of the pandemic savings still remain, so they can't spend it again — they spent it once, they can't do it again,"" Shepherdson says. ""So, I think that suggests maybe a dichotomy where if you're at the top end of the business — the travel and leisure sectors, and maybe even in terms of goods as well — your customers still have money. But most households, by definition, are not in the top 20%, and they're going to find things much more difficult.""
